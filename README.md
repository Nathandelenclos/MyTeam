## About
<div id="about"></div>
The aim of the project was to provide a practical and hands-on experience in setting up a network system by developing a server and a command-line interface (CLI) representing a Teams-like application. Throughout the development process, we were required to explore and learn the fundamental principles of networking such as sockets and connections, while focusing on the practical aspects of programming in the C language. Moreover, the innovative and stimulating aspect of the project was that we were encouraged to design our own communication protocol to facilitate data exchanges between the server and the CLI interface. In summary, this project offered a unique opportunity to acquire key technical skills in the field of network programming and protocol design.
